The Great Migration is not an event. It's a continuous movement of 1.5 million wildebeest, plus zebras and gazelles, in an endless loop following the rain and the grass. Understanding this transforms how you plan around it.

## The circular reality

The herds never stop moving. There is no starting point and no ending point. They follow the grass, which follows the rain. The cycle has been running for millennia.

What we call "the migration" is really us picking moments from this continuous process. River crossings are spectacular. Calving is dramatic. But the migration is happening in January and April and October—it just looks different in each location.

This matters because the question "when is the best time to see the migration?" has no single answer. It depends on what aspect of the migration interests you.

## The annual cycle mapped

**December through March**: Herds concentrate in the southern Serengeti plains around Ndutu. This is calving season—hundreds of thousands of births over a few weeks, with predators hunting vulnerable newborns. The grass is green. Rain is possible.

**April through May**: The herds move northwest toward the central Serengeti. This is low season—rain is common, some camps close, but the herds are moving and vulnerable young animals still provide predator opportunities.

**June**: Herds gather in the central and western Serengeti, preparing for river crossings. The Grumeti River sees crossings first.

**July through October**: Herds cross into the northern Serengeti and Masai Mara. River crossings at the Mara River are possible throughout this window. The timing of specific crossings is unpredictable.

**November**: Herds return south, following early rains. The cycle restarts.

## Why crossings dominate the conversation

River crossings produce the most dramatic footage. Thousands of wildebeest plunge into crocodile-filled water. Some make it; some don't. The tension is visible.

But crossings are unpredictable and brief. A crossing might happen at 7am, before your vehicle arrives, or at 3pm when you've given up and left for lunch. Some days have multiple crossings. Some weeks have none.

Guides communicate constantly via radio. When a herd gathers at a crossing point, word spreads fast. But even with positioning and patience, you might spend three days near the river and miss every crossing.

This isn't failure. This is wildlife operating independently of human schedules.

## The calving alternative

Calving season offers more consistent action. The herds are concentrated. Predators are active. Births happen throughout the day. Cheetahs and lions stalk young calves in visible pursuits.

The experience is different from crossings—less singular drama, more sustained intensity. Some travelers find calving more rewarding because the action is more reliably present.

Calving happens during green season. Rain is possible. Accommodations are slightly cheaper. Crowds are lighter than peak season.

## The timing uncertainty

Safari guides speak with confidence about where the herds "should be" in any given month. But the herds follow rain, not calendars.

In a late-rain year, the herds may stay south longer. In an early-rain year, they may move north sooner. The rough patterns hold over decades, but any specific year can vary.

This uncertainty increases as you plan further ahead. If you're booking for next August, you're making a reasonable bet that the herds will be in the northern Serengeti or Mara. But it's a bet, not a certainty.

## Flexibility as strategy

If migration is essential to your trip, flexibility helps:

**Flexible dates**: Being able to shift your trip by a few weeks gives you options if the herds are early or late.

**Flexible location**: Booking camps in multiple zones lets you follow the herds rather than waiting for them.

**Longer stays**: A 7-day trip has higher odds of catching good action than a 4-day trip. More time equals more chances.

**Acceptance of uncertainty**: Even with flexibility, you may not see a dramatic crossing or a kill. This is the nature of wildlife observation.

## The peak season trade-off

July through September offers the highest probability of migration drama—river crossings are possible, herds are concentrated, weather is dry. This is why it's peak season.

But peak season means peak prices and peak crowds. Vehicles jostle at crossing points. Camps book out months ahead. The premium can be 30-50% above shoulder seasons.

The calculation depends on your priorities. If witnessing a crossing is the primary goal, paying the premium and accepting the crowds is sensible. If you want migration exposure but don't need peak drama, shoulder months (June, October, November) offer better value.

## What this means for your decision

The verdict helps you choose timing based on your inputs. This context helps you understand that there is no objectively "best" time—only trade-offs between different aspects of a continuous phenomenon.

The migration will be happening whenever you go. The question is what expression of it you'll encounter.
