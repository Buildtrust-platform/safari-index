  "summary": "For most first-time travelers, staying in one country provides a more coherent, less logistically complex experience. Multi-country trips make sense when combining genuinely different experiences (safari plus gorillas, for example). The added flights, border crossings, and logistics of multi-country trips rarely justify the complexity for wildlife viewing alone.",
