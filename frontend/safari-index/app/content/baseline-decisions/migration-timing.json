  "summary": "The Great Migration follows a general annual pattern, but exact locations and timing vary year to year. The herds are generally in southern Serengeti for calving (January-March), central Serengeti (April-May), northern Serengeti and Mara (July-October), and returning south (November-December). River crossings depend on rain and cannot be precisely scheduled.",
