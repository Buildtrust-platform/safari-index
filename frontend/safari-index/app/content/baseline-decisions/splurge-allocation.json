  "headline": "Strategic splurging maximizes impact on safari experience",
  "summary": "When allocating a safari splurge budget, prioritize in this order: guide quality (private vehicle with excellent guide), location (inside park or prime conservancy), and finally accommodation luxury. A skilled guide in a basic camp creates better memories than average guiding at a luxury lodge. If upgrading accommodation, invest in one exceptional property rather than spreading across all nights.",
