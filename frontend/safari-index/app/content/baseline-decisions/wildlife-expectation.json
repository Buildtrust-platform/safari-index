  "summary": "On a well-planned safari, you will see significant wildlife. The Big Five (lion, leopard, elephant, rhino, buffalo) are likely but not guaranteed on every trip. Leopard and rhino are the hardest; lion, elephant, and buffalo are almost certain in good areas. Managing expectations about specific species while appreciating overall wildlife abundance leads to satisfaction.",
