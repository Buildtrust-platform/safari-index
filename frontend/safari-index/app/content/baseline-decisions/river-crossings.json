  "summary": "Mara River crossings are spectacular but unpredictable. Even during peak crossing season (July-October), herds may wait days at the river or cross at unpredictable times. Camps near crossing points improve odds but cannot guarantee sightings. A trip focused solely on crossings may disappoint; crossings should be possible bonus, not the primary goal.",
