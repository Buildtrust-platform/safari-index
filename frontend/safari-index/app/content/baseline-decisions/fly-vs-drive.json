  "summary": "Internal flights in Tanzania save significant time (7-hour drives become 1-hour flights) but add $200-500 per person per segment. Driving offers flexibility, scenic variety, and lower costs but consumes game viewing time. For short trips, flying is often worth the premium. For longer trips or budget focus, driving can work well.",
