  "summary": "For first-time safari travelers, booking through a specialized agent provides considerable benefits: destination expertise, camp relationships, crisis support, and itinerary optimization. While direct booking saves 10-15% on commission, the hidden complexity of safari logistics often leads to suboptimal choices. The value proposition shifts after 2-3 safaris when travelers understand the ecosystem.",
