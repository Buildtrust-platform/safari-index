  "summary": "Safari packages advertised at $100-150/day typically involve compromises: shared minibuses with 6-8 passengers, accommodations outside parks (adding 1-2 hours transit daily), rigid itineraries, rushed game drives, and limited guide quality. While some budget options deliver genuine value, deals that seem too good often result in disappointing experiences.",
