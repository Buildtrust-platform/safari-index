  "summary": "August is one of the best months for Kenya safari. The Great Migration is typically in the Masai Mara, river crossings are possible, and dry season conditions make wildlife viewing excellent. This is also peak season with highest prices and most visitors. The combination of migration presence and dry conditions makes August exceptional.",
