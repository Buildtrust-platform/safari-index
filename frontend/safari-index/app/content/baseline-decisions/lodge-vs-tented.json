  "headline": "Both deliver excellent experiences with different atmospheres",
  "summary": "Permanent lodges offer more conventional hotel-like comfort with solid walls and consistent amenities. Tented camps offer immersive bush atmosphere while still providing excellent comfort (proper beds, en-suite bathrooms). Luxury tented camps are not camping. The choice is about atmosphere preference, not comfort level.",
