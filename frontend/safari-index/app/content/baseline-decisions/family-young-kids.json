  "summary": "Safari with children under 6 is possible but requires specific accommodations. Many camps have minimum age policies (often 6-12 years) due to safety and noise concerns. Family-friendly camps exist but limit options significantly. Children under 6 may not have the patience for long game drives or understand the need for quiet observation.",
