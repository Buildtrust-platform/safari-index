  "summary": "A 5-day safari is viable and will deliver meaningful wildlife experiences. However, 7-10 days allows for more relaxed pacing, recovery from jet lag, and better odds of specific sightings. Each additional day increases chances of seeing elusive species. For first-time travelers, 7 days is the sweet spot between value and experience.",
