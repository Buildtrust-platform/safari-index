  "summary": "Luxury camps offer exceptional comfort, service, food, and often better locations with private concession access. However, the wildlife is the same. The value of luxury is in the experience between drives and the exclusivity of location. For first-time visitors focused purely on wildlife, mid-range camps deliver 90% of the experience at 50% of the cost.",
