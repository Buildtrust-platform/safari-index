  "headline": "Multiple camps add variety but consume travel time",
  "summary": "Moving between camps provides ecosystem variety and avoids single-location fatigue. However, each move costs half a day of game viewing to transit and settle. For trips under 6 days, one or two camps is often better. For longer trips, 2-3 camps provides good variety without excessive transit. More than 3 camps rarely adds value.",
