  "headline": "Value season offers compelling wildlife with significant savings",
  "summary": "Peak season (June-October in most regions) offers optimal conditions but 30-50% higher prices. Value/shoulder seasons provide excellent wildlife viewing with 20-40% savings, fewer crowds, and photogenic landscapes. The trade-off involves weather unpredictability and some road accessibility challenges. For flexible travelers, value season often delivers better overall experience.",
