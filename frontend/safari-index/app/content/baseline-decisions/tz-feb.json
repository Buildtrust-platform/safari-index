  "headline": "February is excellent for Tanzania with calving season",
  "summary": "February is one of the best months for Tanzania safari, particularly for calving in the southern Serengeti. The wildebeest calving spectacle peaks mid-February with thousands of births daily and exceptional predator action. This is technically green season with occasional rain, but conditions are generally good and prices are lower than dry season.",
