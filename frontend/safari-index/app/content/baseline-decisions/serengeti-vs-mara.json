  "headline": "Both are exceptional; timing determines the better choice",
  "summary": "The Serengeti and Masai Mara are part of the same ecosystem separated by a border. The migration moves between them seasonally. The Serengeti offers greater scale and variety across regions. The Mara offers compact, concentrated wildlife with off-road driving permitted. For migration, timing determines which side is better; for general safari, both deliver exceptionally.",
