  "summary": "The calving season (late January through March) in southern Serengeti is one of the best times for predator sightings. Thousands of wildebeest give birth daily, attracting lions, cheetahs, and hyenas. The landscape is green and photogenic. This is a green season experience with occasional rain but exceptional wildlife action.",
