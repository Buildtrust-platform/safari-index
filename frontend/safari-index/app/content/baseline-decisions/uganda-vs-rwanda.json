  "summary": "Rwanda and Uganda both provide exceptional gorilla encounters. Rwanda charges $1,500 per permit but delivers a polished, efficient experience—gorilla trekking is possible in a 2-3 day trip. Uganda charges $700 per permit but requires longer, rougher travel. Uganda also offers chimps and other primates as add-ons. The right choice depends on whether you prioritize time efficiency or budget and wildlife variety.",
