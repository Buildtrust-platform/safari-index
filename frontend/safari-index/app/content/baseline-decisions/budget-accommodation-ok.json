  "summary": "Budget safari accommodations (basic lodges, public camp sites, or simple tented camps) can deliver good wildlife experiences at 50-70% cost savings. The tradeoffs are less comfortable beds, shared facilities, larger groups, and less experienced guides. For travelers prioritizing time in the bush over comfort, budget works. The wildlife is the same.",
