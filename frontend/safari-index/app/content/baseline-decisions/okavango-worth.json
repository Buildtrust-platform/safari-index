  "summary": "The Okavango Delta offers unique water-based safari experiences unavailable elsewhere: mokoro rides, boat safaris, and wildlife along channels. However, it costs 2-3x more than East African alternatives. For first-time safari travelers, the premium may not be worth paying before experiencing more accessible destinations. For those seeking something genuinely different, it delivers.",
