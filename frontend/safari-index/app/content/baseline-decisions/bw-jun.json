  "summary": "June is one of the best months for Botswana, particularly the Okavango Delta. The annual flood peaks, enabling mokoro and boat activities, while weather is dry and cool. Wildlife concentrates around permanent water. This is early high season with excellent conditions but not yet at peak July-August prices.",
