  "headline": "Inside offers early access; outside may offer night drives",
  "summary": "Camps inside national parks offer immediate access at gate opening and eliminate transit time. Camps outside parks (in private conservancies or nearby) often offer activities not permitted inside: night drives, walking safaris, and off-road driving. The choice depends on which activities matter more than pure park access timing.",
