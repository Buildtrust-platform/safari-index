  "summary": "For first-time safari travelers, 7-10 days on the ground in Africa (including safari and any extensions) provides the ideal balance. This allows 5-7 days of actual safari, time to recover from jet lag, and possibly a beach or cultural extension. Shorter trips feel rushed; longer trips may experience diminishing returns on wildlife novelty.",
