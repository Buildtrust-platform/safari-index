Thin-Edge Scope Constitution

(Focus · Learning Efficiency · Controlled Expansion)

1. PURPOSE OF THIS DOCUMENT

This document defines where the platform begins, what it intentionally ignores, and how it earns the right to expand.

It exists to prevent:

diluted learning

noisy feedback

premature generalization

building “for everyone” and serving no one

2. CORE PRINCIPLE (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

The platform earns breadth through depth.

Expansion is a reward, not a starting point.

3. DEFINITION OF “THIN EDGE”

A thin edge is:

a narrowly defined user psychology

with repeating decision patterns

and high consequence of error

The thinner the edge, the faster the learning.

4. INITIAL THIN EDGE (LOCKED EXAMPLE)

First-time safari travelers planning a 7–12 day East Africa trip, traveling as couples or families, mid-range to premium budgets, high anxiety about making a wrong choice.

Why this edge:

high stakes

low prior knowledge

strong need for guidance

clear regret patterns

meaningful revenue

5. WHAT IS INCLUDED IN SCOPE

East Africa core destinations

Standard safari durations

Classic trade-offs (timing, crowding, pace, cost)

First-decision clarity

This is intentional simplicity.

6. WHAT IS EXCLUDED (ON PURPOSE)

Ultra-budget travel

Expert multi-country itineraries

Hardcore adventure niches

Repeat Africa veterans

Group tour optimization

Extreme customization logic

These distort early learning.

7. EXPANSION CRITERIA (VERY IMPORTANT)

The platform may expand scope only when:

Decision Completion Rate is stable or rising

Decision Reversal Rate is low

Correction loops show diminishing assumption failures

The new segment shares similar decision psychology

Expansion without meeting these is forbidden.

8. EXPANSION ORDER (GUIDANCE, NOT TIMELINE)

Correct expansion sequence:

Adjacent traveler types

Adjacent geographies

Adjacent complexity levels

Adjacent price tiers

Never expand on all axes at once.

9. HOW THIS CONSTRAINS PRODUCT & AI

Features must serve the thin edge first

AI prompts are tuned to thin-edge psychology

Edge cases outside scope trigger refusal or simplification

AI must not generalize prematurely.

10. FAILURE MODE THIS PREVENTS

Without this constitution, the platform would:

chase SEO breadth

confuse users

degrade authority

slow learning

become generic

This document prevents that decay.

11. EDGE CASE COMPASS

When deciding whether to include a feature or segment, ask:

“Does this make learning clearer or noisier?”

If noisier, refuse.

12. FINAL LOCK STATEMENT

We start narrow to become accurate.
We become accurate to earn trust.
We earn trust to expand responsibly.
Focus is not limitation. Focus is leverage.
