Product Boundaries & Refusal Doctrine

(Focus · Integrity · Anti-Drift)

1. PURPOSE OF THIS DOCUMENT

This document defines what the platform refuses to be, serve, or optimize for, even when:

there is demand

competitors are doing it

short-term revenue is possible

growth metrics would improve

It exists to prevent silent dilution, which is the most common way good products fail.

If this document is ignored, the platform will still grow — but it will lose authority.

2. CORE PRINCIPLE (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Focus is enforced by refusal, not by intention.

What the platform refuses determines:

who trusts it

how it sounds

what it is allowed to become

3. THE REFUSAL PHILOSOPHY

The platform is designed to:

reduce decision burden

share responsibility

minimize regret

Any feature, audience, or behavior that conflicts with these goals must be refused, even if profitable in isolation.

Refusal is not negativity.
Refusal is discipline.

4. USERS WE DO NOT OPTIMIZE FOR (EXPLICIT)

The platform does not optimize for:

4.1 Price-Only Shoppers

Users whose primary criterion is “cheapest possible option”, regardless of trade-offs.

Why refused

Forces hiding of trade-offs

Encourages overpromising

Increases regret and disputes

4.2 Guarantee Seekers

Users who demand certainty on:

wildlife sightings

weather

exact outcomes

Why refused

Guarantees are incompatible with reality

Accepting this demand would require dishonesty

4.3 Endless Comparison Browsers

Users who:

refuse narrowing

resist conclusions

seek exhaustive lists

Why refused

The platform exists to end comparison, not extend it

Catering to this behavior undermines authority

4.4 Unrealistic Constraint Combinations

Examples:

peak season experience at off-season cost

zero drive fatigue with maximal coverage

luxury experience with minimal budget

Why refused

Pretending these can be solved erodes trust

4.5 High-Volume, Low-Intent Traffic

Traffic segments that:

inflate engagement

do not lead to decisions

distort metrics

Why refused

They pollute learning signals

They push UX toward entertainment

5. FEATURES WE DO NOT BUILD (LOCKED)

The platform does not include:

Large filter panels

Endless result lists

“You may also like” carousels

Gamified elements

Badges, streaks, or rewards

Chatty conversational bots

Social proof widgets without context

Countdown timers unless factually justified

Each of these shifts responsibility back to the user or introduces pressure.

6. GROWTH PATHS WE DO NOT CHASE

We explicitly refuse:

SEO volume without decision intent

Paid traffic that converts to browsing, not decisions

Affiliate models that reward indecision

Lead resale models

Monetization that depends on confusion

Growth that weakens judgment is rejected.

7. MONETIZATION REFUSALS

The platform does not monetize by:

charging for access to basic clarity

paywalling honest information

upselling urgency

bundling unnecessary services

Monetization must align with:

responsibility sharing

decision confidence

regret reduction

If revenue conflicts with correctness, revenue is refused.

8. PARTNER & OPERATOR BOUNDARIES

The platform refuses to partner with:

operators who demand content control

operators who restrict honest trade-off disclosure

partners who pressure optimistic framing

partners who benefit from indecision

Authority is not delegated.

9. EDGE CASE REFUSAL COMPASS

When deciding whether to expand scope, ask:

Does this reduce or increase decision burden?

Does this help users avoid regret?

Does this require hiding trade-offs?

Does this weaken the platform’s ability to say “this is not a good fit”?

If any answer is unfavorable, the expansion is refused.

10. HOW THIS DOCTRINE CONSTRAINS AI

AI systems must:

refuse to answer when inputs are unrealistic

name incompatibilities clearly

avoid “best effort” recommendations that hide conflict

resist completing impossible requests

AI is not allowed to “try anyway” when a request violates reality.

Example (Correct):

These requirements conflict in practice. Proceeding would increase the risk of disappointment.

Example (Incorrect):

Here’s a possible option you might consider.

11. HOW THIS DOCTRINE CONSTRAINS UX

UX must:

surface refusals calmly

explain why something is not advisable

offer alternative paths when appropriate

normalize “not proceeding”

Refusal must feel protective, not dismissive.

12. INTERNAL ENFORCEMENT RULE

Any team member, feature proposal, or AI output may be challenged with one question:

“Does this violate the Refusal Doctrine?”

If yes, it is rejected without debate.

13. CROSS-REFERENCES

This document is constrained by:

Decision Philosophy & Responsibility Doctrine

Brand Voice & Language Constitution

This document constrains:

Feature roadmap

Monetization design

SEO strategy

Partner strategy

AI behavior rules

If conflict exists, this document wins over growth initiatives.

14. FINAL LOCK STATEMENT

We do not chase everyone.
We do not optimize for confusion.
We do not hide trade-offs to close deals.
We refuse growth that weakens judgment.
Focus is how we remain credible.

Status

LOCKED — Version 1.0

No feature, partnership, monetization path, or AI behavior may violate this doctrine.
