Decision Review & Correction Doctrine

(Learning · Humility · Long-Term Authority)

1. PURPOSE OF THIS DOCUMENT

This document defines how the platform learns from decisions after they are made.

It exists to prevent the most dangerous failure mode of authority systems:

Being confidently wrong — and not noticing.

Without this doctrine:

early success hardens bad logic

AI amplifies flawed assumptions

trust decays invisibly

reputation collapses suddenly

Authority is not about being right once.
It is about getting less wrong over time.

2. CORE PRINCIPLE (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Every decision issued by the platform is provisional and auditable.

No recommendation is final.
Only reviewed recommendations earn authority.

3. WHAT “REVIEW” MEANS (DICTIONARY)

A decision review is not:

user feedback only

complaint handling

support tickets

anecdotal stories

A decision review is:

structured

repeatable

comparative

logic-focused

We review reasoning, not outcomes alone.

4. DECISIONS THAT MUST BE REVIEWED

Not every interaction is reviewed. Reviews are focused.

Mandatory review categories

Decisions that resulted in regret signals

Decisions that required refusal

Decisions involving high uncertainty

Decisions involving seasonal or environmental risk

Decisions that were later reversed

Decisions attached to Decision Assurance

If a decision affects trust, it must be reviewed.

5. REVIEW CADENCE (LOCKED)
Monthly Micro-Review

Purpose: detect early drift.

Small, representative sample

Focus on logic clarity

Identify recurring confusion points

Questions asked:

Were assumptions explicit?

Were trade-offs understood?

Did the verdict reduce burden?

Did users feel “relieved” or “unsure”?

Quarterly Deep Review

Purpose: evolve intelligence.

Pattern analysis across months

Identification of flawed heuristics

Retirement of outdated logic

Adjustment of thresholds and triggers

This is where the platform improves its judgment.

6. FAILURE CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM

Every reviewed issue is classified into one category:

Assumption Failure
The assumption was wrong or incomplete.

Communication Failure
The reasoning was correct but poorly explained.

Scope Failure
The platform should have refused to decide.

External Shock
Conditions changed beyond reasonable foresight.

Each category has a different response.
Lumping them together is forbidden.

7. CORRECTION RULES (IMPORTANT)
If assumption failure occurs:

update logic

annotate future decisions

adjust confidence language

If communication failure occurs:

rewrite templates

clarify trade-off sections

revise examples

If scope failure occurs:

tighten refusal thresholds

reduce automation range

escalate to human-in-the-loop

If external shock occurs:

improve monitoring

refine alert triggers

do not rewrite logic defensively

Do not “overcorrect” for rare events.

8. PUBLIC VS INTERNAL CORRECTIONS
Internal corrections

always logged

always tracked

never hidden

External corrections

used selectively

framed calmly

explained without defensiveness

Transparency increases trust only when it is sober.

9. REGRET SIGNALS (VERY IMPORTANT)

The platform treats the following as regret signals:

repeated clarification requests after decision

sudden disengagement after booking

hesitation expressed post-verdict

reversal without new information

These signals are more valuable than praise.

10. HOW THIS DOCTRINE CONSTRAINS AI

AI systems must:

flag uncertainty instead of masking it

log decisions for audit

revise behavior when patterns change

downgrade confidence when corrections occur

AI is not allowed to:

defend itself

rationalize errors

maintain tone consistency at the expense of truth

Correctness beats personality.

11. EDGE CASE COMPASS

When choosing between:

preserving authority

admitting uncertainty

Choose admitting uncertainty.

When choosing between:

consistency

correctness

Choose correctness.

Authority is cumulative honesty.

12. FINAL LOCK STATEMENT

We do not fear being wrong.
We fear staying wrong.
Every decision is a hypothesis, not a promise.
Learning is how authority compounds.
