Brand Voice & Language Constitution

(Bible · Dictionary · Compass)

1. PURPOSE OF THIS DOCUMENT

This document defines how the product speaks, sounds, breathes, and behaves linguistically across:

copywriting

UX text

AI-generated content

system messages

error states

reports

emails

future interfaces

Why this document exists

Because this product relies on:

trust

judgment

responsibility

calm authority

Any drift in language:

destroys credibility

introduces doubt

makes the system feel “salesy” or “AI-ish”

undermines decision authority

If this document is violated, the implementation is wrong, regardless of how clever or functional it is.

2. CORE PRINCIPLE (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

The platform speaks like someone who has seen this many times before and does not need to convince you.

Everything flows from this.

3. VOICE IDENTITY (DEFINED, NOT IMPLIED)
The voice is:

Calm

Observational

Measured

Precise

Experienced

Honest

Non-performative

The voice is NOT:

Excited

Persuasive

Promotional

Trendy

Casual

Conversational

Chatty

“Friendly” in a sales sense

If the copy feels like it is trying to win the user, it is wrong.

4. REFERENCE ARCHETYPE (VERY IMPORTANT)

When in doubt, imagine the voice as:

a senior safari planner explaining reality after years in the field

a travel editor writing a considered assessment

a quiet advisor briefing a family before a major expense

Not:

a tour agent

a blogger

a startup founder

a chatbot

a travel influencer

This archetype overrides personal taste.

5. SENTENCE STRUCTURE & RHYTHM
Sentence length

Short to medium sentences preferred

Long sentences allowed only when clarity improves

Never long sentences for flourish

Rhythm rules

One idea per paragraph

Paragraphs may be as short as one sentence

Silence (white space) is intentional

Correct example

February is not a bad month for Tanzania.
It is, however, uneven.
What you gain is space.
What you give up is predictability.

Incorrect example

February offers a unique blend of opportunity and tranquility, making it an excellent choice for travelers seeking a balance between crowd-free exploration and rewarding wildlife encounters.

Why incorrect:

promotional

vague

evasive

sounds like marketing

6. VOCABULARY CONSTITUTION (DICTIONARY)
Forbidden words and phrases (absolute ban)

These words must never appear anywhere:

unforgettable

magical

once-in-a-lifetime

breathtaking

seamless

curated

unlock

elevate

world-class

tailor-made (without explanation)

hidden gem

bucket list

AI-powered

If AI outputs these, the prompt is wrong.

Preferred vocabulary (signals authority)

Words we actively encourage:

trade-off

likelihood

depends on

tends to

typically

often

rarely

in practice

worth it if

not ideal if

assumes

requires

carries risk

These words communicate thinking, not selling.

7. HOW UNCERTAINTY IS HANDLED
Rule

Uncertainty is named, not hidden.

We do not:

pretend certainty

soften risk

bury caveats

Correct

Wildlife sightings vary. This month increases the chance, not the guarantee.

Incorrect

You’ll have amazing wildlife viewing opportunities.

The first builds trust.
The second erodes it.

8. EMOTIONAL POSTURE (SUBTLE BUT CRITICAL)

The platform must quietly communicate:

You’re not late.

Your hesitation is reasonable.

This decision deserves care.

You are not expected to know this already.

Responsibility is shared.

The platform never shames, pressures, or rushes.

9. CALLS TO ACTION (LANGUAGE LAW)
CTA philosophy

CTAs must feel like assistance, not instruction.

Forbidden CTA styles

“Book now”

“Get started”

“Unlock your safari”

“Don’t miss out”

Approved CTA styles

“Check whether this fits you”

“See what changes if you wait”

“Create a draft plan”

“Get a clear recommendation”

If a CTA sounds like a button on a sales funnel, it is wrong.

10. HOW THE PLATFORM “BREATHES”
Visual-language coupling rule

Language must match layout:

calm text → spacious layout

serious tone → restrained design

no dense copy blocks

no exclamation points

no emoji

no hype punctuation

Typography carries authority, not decoration.

11. ERROR STATES & SYSTEM MESSAGES

Even errors follow the voice.

Correct

We don’t have enough information yet to give a reliable recommendation.

Incorrect

Oops! Something went wrong. Try again!

Errors are treated as incomplete information, not failure.

12. HOW AI IS CONSTRAINED BY THIS DOCUMENT

This section is mandatory for vibe coding.

AI is allowed to:

explain reasoning

summarize trade-offs

express uncertainty

revise conclusions

say “this is not ideal”

AI is NOT allowed to:

hype

persuade

reassure emotionally

anthropomorphize itself

explain that it is AI

invent confidence

soften trade-offs

AI prompt enforcement rule

Every AI prompt must include:

“Use calm, observational language.
Avoid marketing phrases.
Name trade-offs explicitly.
Do not exaggerate or reassure.”

If AI output violates tone, the system corrects the prompt, not the output.

13. EDGE CASE DECISION GUIDE (COMPASS)

When two wording options both seem acceptable:

Choose the one that:

reduces responsibility on the user

names risk earlier

sounds less impressive

feels slightly understated

Understatement beats persuasion every time.

14. CROSS-REFERENCES

This document governs and constrains:

UX & Task Flow Constitution

Decision Philosophy & Responsibility Doctrine

AI Prompt & Behavior Rules

Content Templates

Error Handling Protocol

If another document conflicts with this one, this one wins.

15. FINAL LOCK STATEMENT

We speak plainly.
We explain trade-offs.
We do not rush decisions.
We do not exaggerate outcomes.
We stand with the user when uncertainty exists.

This is not a brand style.
This is a commitment.

Status

LOCKED — Version 1.0

No implementation, copy, AI prompt, or UX decision may override this document.
