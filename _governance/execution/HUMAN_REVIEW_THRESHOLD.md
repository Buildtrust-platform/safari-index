# Human Review Threshold

Defines preconditions for introducing human-reviewed assurance as a premium tier.

---

## Core Principle

Human review is introduced only when automated assurance has proven demand and quality. Human review is a premium addition, not a replacement or apology for automation.

---

## Preconditions for Introduction

ALL of the following must be true before human review is offered:

### Automated Assurance Demand (Required)
- Minimum 50 automated assurances issued total
- Minimum 10 automated assurances issued in the trailing 4 weeks
- Assurance-to-decision ratio above 5% (at least 5% of decisions convert to assurance)

### Automated Assurance Quality (Required)
- Zero revoked assurances due to accuracy failures
- Confidence floor maintained above 0.6 for all issued assurances
- No quality gate failures for assurance-eligible decisions in 4 weeks

### Operational Readiness (Required)
- Founder has completed at least 10 practice reviews (internal, not sold)
- Average review time measured and documented
- Review checklist exists and has been tested
- Response time SLA defined and achievable

---

## Minimum Automated Assurance Demand

- Human review cannot be offered until automated assurance has:
  - At least 50 cumulative purchases
  - At least 4 weeks of continuous availability
  - At least 3 distinct topics with assurance demand

- Rationale: Human review requires proven willingness to pay. Automated assurance proves this at lower risk.

---

## Confidence Floor Requirements

Human review is offered only for decisions where:

- Automated confidence is between 0.5 and 0.75
- Decisions with confidence >0.75 do not need human review
- Decisions with confidence <0.5 should be refused, not reviewed

Human review must result in:

- Confidence increase of at least 0.1
- OR explicit statement of why confidence cannot increase
- No human review should lower confidence (if it would, refuse instead)

---

## Time-Per-Review Constraints

### Maximum Time Allocation
- Maximum 30 minutes per review
- Reviews exceeding 30 minutes indicate topic is too complex
- If average review time exceeds 20 minutes, raise price or narrow scope

### Capacity Planning
- Maximum 5 reviews per day (solo founder)
- No same-day delivery promise
- Minimum 48-hour turnaround SLA
- No weekend or holiday reviews promised

### Overflow Protocol
- If queue exceeds 10 pending reviews, pause new sales
- Resume only when queue drops below 5
- No "rush" pricing or expedited options

---

## Price Floor Rules

### Absolute Floor
- Human review price must be at least 3x automated assurance price
- If automated assurance is $X, human review is minimum $3X

### Justification
- Human review is premium, not discount
- Lower price implies automated assurance is inadequate
- Price signals scarcity and value, not apology

### Price Relationship
- Human review price may increase but never decrease below floor
- Automated assurance price changes require human review price recalculation
- No bundling that reduces effective human review price

---

## What Human Review Adds

Human review must provide tangible additions:

- Personalized assumption verification
- Specific itinerary feedback (if provided)
- Direct response to user's stated concerns
- Signed-off confidence with reviewer attribution

Human review does NOT:

- Change the automated verdict (only confidence)
- Provide booking services
- Guarantee outcomes
- Offer ongoing support

---

## Introduction Process

When all preconditions are met:

1. Document decision to introduce human review with evidence
2. Set initial price at 3x automated floor
3. Soft launch to 5 customers maximum
4. Collect feedback for 2 weeks
5. Adjust time estimates and price if needed
6. Full launch only after soft launch validation

---

## Prohibited Patterns

- Offering human review to "save" a failing automated product
- Using human review as default recommendation
- Pricing human review below automated to drive volume
- Promising expertise beyond founder's knowledge
- Offering human review for topics with <0.5 confidence
- Scaling human review with contractors before founder capacity is exhausted
