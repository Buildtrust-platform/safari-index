# Founder Protocol

Defines operational rules for founder behavior during Observation Mode, especially under stress.

---

## Core Principle

This document exists because founders make poor decisions under stress. These rules were written when calm. Follow them when not calm.

## What to Do If Week 1-2 Is Quiet

### Definition of "Quiet"
- Fewer than 10 page views per day
- Zero assurance purchases
- Zero follow-up subscriptions
- No embed renders

### Required Actions
- Continue collecting observation data (do not skip reports)
- Review data collection commands for errors
- Verify analytics are functioning (check /api/ops/health)
- Document the quiet period in observation report

### Permitted Actions
- Share existing decision pages in relevant communities (max 2 shares per week)
- Respond to any inbound questions
- Continue scheduled observation tasks

### Prohibited Actions
- Add new features to "attract traffic"
- Change pricing to "test demand"
- Add new decision topics "to have more content"
- Pivot domain or audience
- Announce publicly that things are slow
- Seek reassurance from others about the product

### Reminder
- Quiet does not mean failure
- 2 weeks is not enough data
- The product is being observed, not promoted
- Patience is the protocol

## What to Do If Feedback Is Negative

### Definition of "Negative Feedback"
- User explicitly states decision was wrong
- User requests refund for assurance
- User publicly criticizes the product
- Confidence is challenged with evidence

### Required Actions
- Document feedback verbatim in observation report
- Categorize feedback: accuracy, clarity, expectations, other
- If accuracy concern: verify decision logic, do not change immediately
- If refund requested: process refund, document reason

### Permitted Actions
- Respond to user acknowledging feedback (no defensiveness)
- Ask clarifying questions if feedback is vague
- Note patterns across multiple feedback instances

### Prohibited Actions
- Change decision logic based on single feedback instance
- Apologize for the product's existence
- Offer compensation beyond stated refund policy
- Argue with the user about their experience
- Remove or hide the criticized decision
- Add disclaimers reactively

### Threshold for Action
- Single negative feedback: document only
- 3+ similar negative feedbacks: add to Week 4 review agenda
- Accuracy failure confirmed: follow revocation process in decision doctrine

## What to Do If Metrics Conflict

### Common Conflicts
- High traffic but zero conversions
- High conversions but negative feedback
- High confidence but high refusal rate
- Low traffic but high engagement

### Required Actions
- Document both metrics without interpretation
- Do not average or weight conflicting signals
- Present conflict in observation report as-is
- Wait for Week 4 Gate to interpret

### Prohibited Actions
- Choose the metric that "feels right"
- Discard the inconvenient metric
- Create new metrics to reconcile conflict
- Make changes to resolve conflict prematurely

### Reminder
- Conflicting metrics mean insufficient data or model error
- More time resolves data insufficiency
- Model error is identified at Week 4, not Week 1
